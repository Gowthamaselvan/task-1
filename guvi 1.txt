Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.

1.Objects in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.

2.Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.

3.Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer 
  points to the location in memory where the object is stored.

4.Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, 
  of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 

5.If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc 
  and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
Example:
       var myCar = new Object();
       myCar.make = 'Ford';
       myCar.model = 'Mustang';
       myCar.year = 1969;

                                                                                                             HTTP/2

Ithe usest works on the textual format.	                                                                              
                                                                                                        It works on the binary protocol.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it                                  
                                                                                                        It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
until it doesn’t get its all resources. 
	                                                                                                   

It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pagess                                      It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages


It compresses data by itself.   	                                                                       
                                                                                                         It uses HPACK for data compression.
